# The GAP 4 package `crypting'

This package implements some cryptographic primitives. At the moment
this is a custom implementation of SHA256 and HMAC, which is needed
to sign messages in the Jupyter kernel.

Bindings to a full crypto library are a possibility for the future, and
pull-requests (after discussion) are appreciated.
